# IIS160 - Accelerate the Development of SAP Fiori Apps Using SAP Fiori Elements

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2021 session\
**IIS160 - Accelerate the Development of SAP Fiori Apps Using SAP Fiori Elements**.

https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2021-IIS160

## Overview

The use of SAP Fiori elements with OData V4 and SAP Cloud Application Programming Model allows you to\
improve the efficiency of developing SAP Fiori apps.\
In this session you will get hands-on experience developing a standard list report or object page app\
using SAP Fiori elements, and then extend it using the flexible programming model.\
Learn how to use the new features provided with SAP Fiori tools to simplify how you add annotations\
and to personalize the appearance of your app.
